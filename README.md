# Fetal anomalies prediction

This repository contains code and documentation for a classification model that predicts fetal anomalis using Cardiotocography (CPT) data. The model is trained and evaluated using the Cardiotocography dataset, distributed by UC Irvine under CC BY 4.0 license.
The repository contains:
- A notebook with code and annotations for the development and evaluation of model.
- A prototype Python/Flask application that deploys the model and serves an inference API for potential end-users.
- A non-technical .PPT presentation.
